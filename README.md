# Amber -- Front-end
Amber is a service that helps historic groups digitize local history. We believe that there are
interesting stories to find just about anywhere, and we want to help people discover them. 

## Why the name?
Fossils are often preserved in Amber for millions of years. In the same spirit, we want local
history to be preserved so that everyone can enjoy and learn about the places they travel to!
